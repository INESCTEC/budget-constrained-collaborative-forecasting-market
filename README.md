## 1. Introduction  
This project presents a **budget-constrained collaborative forecasting market**, where data owners can **monetize their features**, and buyers can **optimize forecasting performance while staying within a budget**.

### 1.1. What is the main purpose of this project?
This project implements a **collaborative forecasting market** that allows data sellers to monetize their data while data buyers purchase relevant features under a given budget constraint. It uses **Spline LASSO regression** to improve the accuracy of renewable energy forecasting (e.g., wind or solar).

 - **Collaborative forecasting model**: **Spline LASSO regression** 
 - **Bid-based data market** where:
   - **Data sellers** set prices for their features.  
   - **Data buyers** specify a budget or price related to forecast accuracy improvements.  
 - **Incentive Mechanism**: Estimates the more accurate LASSO B-spline model within the budget 
 

### 1.2. Which forecasting tasks does this code target?
We primarily target **wind power forecasting**, though the underlying models can be adapted to other use cases (solar, load forecasting, etc.) if you have suitable time series data.

### 2.1. Are the datasets fully included in the repository?
- **Synthetic Datasets**: Example synthetic data is stored in the `data/` folder, generated via scripts in the `examples/` directory.  
- **Real-world Datasets**: We provide scripts to process the **GEFCom2014** wind power dataset. You need to **manually download** the original GEFCom2014 ([link here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/zwnlfwhds3k2xz0/GEFCom2014.zip?rlkey=oz7unehbwtglp1pbgbnb4wne2&e=1&dl=0)).

## 3. Running the Code

###  Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/INESCTEC/budget-constrained-collaborative-forecasting-market.git
cd budget-constrained-collaborative-forecasting-market
```

### Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Dependencies include:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `scikit-optimize`
- `scipy`
- `sympy`
- `plotnine`

---

The results can be obtained by running the scripts in the 'examples' folder, e.g.:

#### Generate the basic synthetic dataset
```bash
python examples/1-a-generate-basic-synthetic-data.py
```

#### Run the market and obtain the results in Table I of the paper

A folder `results/` will be created to save a .csv with Table I results.
```bash
python examples/1-b-run-markets-basic-synthetic-data.py
```
